# matplotlib-challenge
#This project utilizes Python Matplotlib to generate charts and figures from a pharmaceutical study conducted by the fictional Pymaceuticals Inc., to test the effectiveness of trial treatments in cancer tumors. The data contains the information of 249 mice identified with tumor growth were treated with different drugs. After the trial period of 45 days, the tumors were remeasuerd to test the efficacy of the treatment drugs. 

#This project is broken down into the following tasks:
Preparing the data.
Generating summary statistics.
Creating bar charts and pie charts.
Calculating quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.
Creating a line plot and a scatter plot.
Calculating correlation and regression.
Analyzing the data as a whole 


#For this project I used the lectures from module 5 of the Columbia Data Analytics bootcamp, https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/markers_api.html, and "Matplotlib 3.0  Cookbook" by Srinivasa Rao Poladi to figure out the code needed.
